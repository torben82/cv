%I was born in Aabenraa on January the 31$^{\rm st}$ of 1982, where I have lived for the majority of my life. I am currently working for Danfoss A/S as a research engineer. Since 2011 my research has been focused on Smart Grid or Smart Energy integration of refrigeration systems. 

Structured and customer focued R\&D engineer with an analytical approach toward problem solving. Interest include, refrigeration and heat pump systems, energy optimization, performance assesment of dynamic systems, business analysis and value proposition. Work experience include, development of control algorithms, project management of innovation projects, and creating value propositions and business analysis for novel business ideas.

%My approach toward research is very business oriented. I am always evaluating the risk of a research project against the potential outcome. The ability to complete a research project depends on the ability choose the right project to pursue.
